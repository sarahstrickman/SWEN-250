--Database Exercise--

Section 02

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part 1

Review all of part 1 and record your estimate in the activity journal.

Open the database musicals.sqlite with sqlite3.

Run the .schema command. What are the three "create table" commands used to create the database tables?

["authors", "authors_musicals", "musicals"]

[Write an SQL select command to produce the titles of all the musicals in the database that were first staged in the 1940s. What was the command? What were the results?]

[SELECT title FROM musicals WHERE year >= 1940 AND year <= 1949;]
[Brigadoon, Oklahoma!, South Pacific, Carousel]

Write an SQL select command to produce the titles of all the musicals authored by Oscar Hammerstein. What was the command? What were the results?

[select musicals.title from authors_musicals 
inner join musicals on authors_musicals.musical_id = musicals.id
inner join authors on authors_musicals.author_id = authors.id
where authors.name = "Oscar Hammerstein";]
[Oklahoma!, South Pacific, Carousel, The Sound of Music]

Record your process and observations in the activity journal.

End of Part 1

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part 2

Review all of part 2 and record your estimate in the activity journal.

From this point forward, you may use either sqlite3 from the command line or the SQL Manager add-on to Firefox

Insert two new musicals, with their authors and the proper linkage. The musicals are:

Music Man	1957	Meredith Wilson
Hello, Dolly!	1964	Jerry Herman
Hello, Dolly!	1964	Michael Steward

What SQL commands were executed to completely insert the information for Music Man?

[insert into musicals values (11, "Hello, Dolly!", 1964);
insert into authors (7, "Jerry Herman");
insert into authors values (8, "Michael Steward");
insert into authors_musicals values (7, 11);
insert into authors_musicals values (8, 11);]

Create a new table called Actresses with an auto-increment primary key id (integer) and the actress’s name (a string). Populate the table with the following actresses:
Carol Channing
Pearl Bailey
Shirley Jones
Julie Andrews
Audrey Hepburn

Record your process and observations in the activity journal.

End of Part 2

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part 3

Review all of part 3 and record your estimate in the activity journal.

Create a new linking table called "actresses_musicals" with two integer keys, actress_id and musical_id, and show the SQL command that was executed.

[CREATE TABLE actresses_musicals ("actress_id INTEGER, "musical_id" INTEGER);]

Set up the following links between actresses and musicals in the actresses_musicals table:

Carol Channing	Hello, Dolly
Pearl Bailey	Hello, Dolly
Shirley Jones	Carousel
Audrey Hepburn	My Fair Lady
Julie Andrews	My Fair Lady
Julie Andrews	The Sound of Music

Finally, execute an SQL command to list the names of all the actresses who were ever in a play authored by Oscar Hammerstein. Note that this requires a join across all five tables in the database! Challenging, give it a try.

[SELECT Actresses.name from actresses_musicals
INNER JOIN Actresses on actresses_musicals.actress_id = Actresses.id
INNER JOIN authors_musicals on actresses_musicals.musical_id = authors_musicals.musical_id
INNER JOIN authors on authors_musicals.author_id = authors.id
where authors.name = "Oscar Hammerstein";]

result: Shirley Jones, Julie Andrews
[it doesn't need all 5 tables.]

Record your process and observations in the activity journal.

End of Part 3 and the entire activity.
