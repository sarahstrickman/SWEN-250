=============================================
Start CWordCount
Estimated Time 1H 0M
Plan:
	word = each instance of whitespace following a character
	line = each instance of '\n'
	character = each getchar()

	while getchar() is not EOF,
	record what getchar is, and see if it fits the constraints
		above
	increase the variables accrdingly

Complete
Actual Time  0H 45M
Observations:
	unlike in the other (singular) language that I learned,
	you do not have to open the file with fopen.  You can 
	simply pass it through without specifying it in the program.
	I also learned that it is very inconvenient to use for loops
	when using getchar.
