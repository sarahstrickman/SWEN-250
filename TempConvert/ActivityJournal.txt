SWEN-250 Activity Reflection

Name: Sarah Strickman

===========================================================
Start Part 1
Estimated Time 1H 00M
Plan:
Write entire program in python because it is a language I am familiar with
	(2 functions: one that converts fahrenheit to celcius, one that ddoes the opposite)
Port it to C

Complete
Actual Time  1H 30M
Observations:
C is very different than Python, in that everything has to be written inside 
	of a function. Integers may also be unsigned by default, and this must be
	taken into consideration.  This is a major problem that I consistntly 
	ran into during Activity One. It is also important to realize the type
	of data you are using, and the different things that each form of data is 	
	able to do (for example, 9/5 would return something different than 9.0/5.0).
	

==========================================================
Start Part 2
Estimated Time  1H  0M
Plan:
Copy chart1.c to chart2.c, change ints to doubles, and print the doubles

Complete
Actual Time  0H  20M
Observations:
This was a lot simpler than I thought it would be. using %.1f in the 
	printf statement allows you to print only one character after the 
	defcimal point.  The main function also must return int.
